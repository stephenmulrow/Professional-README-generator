# Professional README Generator

This professional README generator allows the user to enter input to predetermined questions and it will take the responses and automatically put them into the appropriate sections of the README documentation.

In the terminal the user is presented with a list of questions that pertain to their unique project.

You can see a demo video of the application in use here:
